HeLX is a new language that:  
* introduces OOP without any keywords (new, this, super, extends, class, etc)  
* introduces a new pointer model that's explicit and intuitive  
* is built only from expressions and statements  

HeLX, once finished, will:  
* introduce a single intuitive token to unify functional programming, concurrent/async flow, and static properties (no static, async, await, etc)  
* support monads
* support optional static typing, pure functions, and constants
* compile to JVM or CLR

That website used Emscripten to convert the compiler here (written in C) to asm.js
  
HeLX was originally inspired by Javascript and currently compiles to it. That's why the e in HeLX stands for ECMAScript.  
After hearing some of my friends say programming looked confusing/hard over and over again, I decided I wanted to create an extremely consistent, clean, intuitive, and unified programming language. HeLX aims to remove as many keywords as possible while supporting as many programming styles as possible in the most elegant syntax ever created (shoot for the stars right? ;).
